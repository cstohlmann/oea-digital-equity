# Package Documentation
## General Documentation
The current assets located within this package are used to tailor an education system's form of access/connectivity data (data used to assess student access/connectivity), along with student device assignment data (i.e. if devices are checked out by students), and SIS/education system roster data. 

Currently, as this package stands, there isn't a module that supports access/connectivity used by an education institution. Rather, this package is to be used as guidance for how assets were created, and understanding of the dashboard pages. As modules are created, this package will be updated to account for sources of access/connectivity data. 

## Package Asset Use Instructions
The Digital Equity of Access Package provides multiple assets to help accelerate the implementation of digital access analysis in education, specific to equity of access.

1. <strong>[Notebooks]()</strong> 
      * Package notebooks provide example code for standardizing and processing data to make ready for PowerBI dashboards. Notebooks were developed to fit the [OEA framework](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/07aa28a00b36a1822b69a11b1ac04f0748d1b675/framework/notebook/OEA_py.ipynb) and can be edited and adapted to suit any environment. 
2. <strong>[Pipelines]()</strong> 
      * Sample Synapse Pipeline for data cleaning, joining between various tables, post processing, and serving data to PowerBI.
3. <strong>[PowerBI Samples]()</strong> 
      * Example PowerBI dashboards are showcased as developed with key stakeholders at [Fresno Unified School District](https://www.fresnounified.org/). The dashboard data model is also given.
