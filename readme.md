# OEA Digital Learning Insights Packages

<strong><em>\[EDIT\]</strong></em>

This collection of OEA Digital Learning Packages contains technical resources for a variety of common education use cases, related to predicting whether a student needs specialized support. Depending on their context, students may need academic support for specific skills or knowledge domains; they may need support to ensure they can attend and engage in school; or they may need support with their home, health, or safety context. The OEA community has identified three primary categories of student supports that are needed in both primary, secondary and post-secondary education systems.

<strong><em>\[EDIT\]</strong></em>

The OEA packages in this collection can be used to set up the data resources, stakeholder engagement, responsible AI processes, machine learning models, and dashboards that can identify patterns of supports needed and predict which individual students are likely to become in need of supports. The predictions can help education systems and schools choose the right methods of intervention to reduce or prevent student challenges and better support each student’s success.

Each use case package includes Use Case Documentation that provides guidance on the end-to-end process of developing a successful use case project, including how to engage stakeholders in the project, prior research on the use case problem domain and theory, how to map data sources to the theory of the problem, and how to implement principles of responsible data and AI in the process of predictive modelling.

## Library of Digital Learning Insights Use-Cases

The table below describes the use-cases that can be addressed through the OEA Digital Learning Insights packages.

| [Digital Equity of Access](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-digital-equity/tree/main/Digital_Equity_of_Access) | [Digital Engagement]() | [Student Well-Being]() | [Student Digital Learning]() |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Equity - identifying students who do not have quality digital learning access outside school | Present patterns of digital engagement across digital learning ecosystem (all apps and learning resources), relative to access | Patterns of student well-being, (i.e. social-emotional competencies) | Show relationship between app-use and learning outcomes (assessment, knowledge checks, grades, completion/graduation, skills) |
| Identify locations that need better connectivity | Predict patterns of digital engagement to notify educators and schools of potential dis-engagement | Show relationship between access, engagement, learning and well-being | Identify and predict where student academic declines (at-risk) may happen | 
| Predict costs of ensuring equity of maintaining access to digital learning (devices + connectivity) | Identify work \& engagement patterns of staff who are working remotely | Well-being interventions tracking \& <em>de-stigmatizing mental health (may be at risk)</em> | Personalization - metadata on curriculum resources |
| | Hybrid engagement (physical attendance + digital engagement) |  | Recommendations to teachers on curriculum areas / apps |
|  | Student and staff digital activity during and outside of school hours by location (in school or out of school) |  |  |
